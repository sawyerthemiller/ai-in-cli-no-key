1. sorry for really long title... 
2. i am not responsible if your account gets locked by OpenAI for abuse or somthing, additionally you must have Microsft Edge installed and signed into ChatGPT
3. this is able to be used over the internet, but would be massively insecure so consider a cloudflare tunnel or something

EDGE MUST BE KILLED THROUGH TASK MANAGER BEFORE RUNNING THIS OR IT WILL FAIL
